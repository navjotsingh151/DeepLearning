## What is Convolutional Neural Network?
In **deep learning**, a **convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet)** is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.

**CNNs** use a variation of multilayer **perceptrons** designed to require minimal preprocessing. 
They are also known as shift invariant or space invariant **artificial neural networks (SIANN)**, based on their shared-weights architecture and translation invariance characteristics.

CNNs use relatively little pre-processing compared to other image classification algorithms. This means that the network learns the filters that in traditional algorithms were hand-engineered. This independence from prior knowledge and human effort in feature design is a major advantage.

They have applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems, image classification, medical image analysis, and natural language processing.

## Description of Project 

**CNN** is best for the Visual Object recognition. There are numerous number of Dogs and Cats images on Kaggle. CNN is trained on large set of images and then prediction is made on new images.
Here we are going to build a CNN to determine whether the image belongs to **```Cat```** or **```Dog```**.
